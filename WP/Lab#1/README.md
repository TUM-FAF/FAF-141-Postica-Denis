**Windows Programming Laboratory Work #1**


*Window. Window handling. Basic windowâ€™s form elements*

**Contents:**

1. Win32 API
2. GIT
3. Window
4. Button
5. Text Input
6. Text

  In laboratory work no.1 I have created a window with two edit boxes, one to write in, another to output the text. Also, I added four buttons with customized colors. Each button has a function: OK button - accepts the text written in one of edit boxes and outputs it in another one; Calibri button - changes the font of outputted message to calibri; Courier New - changes the font of outputted message to courier new; Exit button - closes the window.
  The biggest problem, while performing the laboratory work no. 1, was to create customized buttons.
