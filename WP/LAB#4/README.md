*Windows Timer. Animation.*

##Contents:

 * Windows timer
 
###What have I done
I have created a Windows application that can create an animation based on Windows timer which 
involves more drawn objects. You can increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel/from
 keyboard. Also, you can add objects (balls) with mouse. These balls change their color at the 
interaction with each other and they became squares on interaction with the right and left wall. To
solve the flicking problem I used double-buffering technique.
